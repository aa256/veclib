Design principle
Map 2d vector graphics onto parameterized 2D surface embedded in 3d space.

Model arm as a cylinder of varying diameter.

Length function:
y axis - untransformed.

x axis - radial axis

d((x1,y1), (x2,y2)) is still sqrt((y2-y1)^2+d(x1,x2)),
where d(x1, x2) here is the short radial path from a to b.

More general question:
What is the shortest distance between two points on a cone?

Can't just use pythagorean principle with these axes.
E.g. Consider traveling from one point at r1, 0 rads to another point
at r2, pi rads, where 0 < r1 < r2.

As cone becomes infinitely wide, it is modeled as a plane.
Then the shortest path between the points is through the origin,
and the shortest path is r2+r1.

At the other extreme, the cone is a line, and the shortest path
is of length r2-r1.

One way to construct the cone is to take a circular piece of paper
and make it into a wedge, like pacman.

Let's implement a Bezier spline.

Txfn - operates on a vector '*'.
Txfn can also operate on itself, via composition.
Txable interface allows a Txfn to operate on it via the transform method.

There are other transformations on Svgables that do not immediately derive
from operators on vectors. SvgTxfn? Txfn<Template>?
