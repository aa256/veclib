Design principle
Map 2d vector graphics onto parameterized 2D surface embedded in 3d space.

Model arm as a cylinder of varying diameter.

Length function:
y axis - untransformed.

x axis - radial axis

d((x1,y1), (x2,y2)) is still sqrt((y2-y1)^2+d(x1,x2)),
where d(x1, x2) here is the short radial path from a to b.

More general question:
What is the shortest distance between two points on a cone?

Let's implement a Bezier spline.

Txfn - operates on a vector '*'.
Txfn can also operate on itself, via composition.
Txable interface allows a Txfn to operate on it via the transform method.

There are other transformations on Svgables that do not immediately derive
from operators on vectors. SvgTxfn? Txfn<Template>?
